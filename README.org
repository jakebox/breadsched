#+TITLE: BreadSched
A website/app to help you time your bread correctly.

* Todos
+ Make the actual schedule 
  * Work backwards time to make schedule of actions
+ Optimize rendering output.html (maybe make a dictionary instead of a )
** Long-term
+ Fix time adjustment calculations
  * Not a good system currently, maybe find some formula to do it, not sure
+ Add submit checking (make sure all boxes are filled out before allowing submit button)
+ Make index.html work better on small width

* Code Plan
** Calculations
*** Needed Data
**** Optimization
+ Maximize for time
+ Aim for specific time of day
**** Bread details
1. Type
2. Dough mixing time
3. 1st rise range & optimum
4. Action time (ex kneading the dough/braiding)
5. 2nd rise range & optimum
6. Time to preheat oven
7. Time to bake
8. Time to cool before eating
**** Assumptions
+ Two rises
+ Aim for specific time of day
+ Prioritize medium-length first rise and correct length second rise
** Calculation Order
1) Find minimum start time
2) Add up all bread times with ideal times
3) Calculate time to begin based on first calculation
   - if time is before minimum start time, redo calculations but using the range options (so subtract say half the allotted range)
