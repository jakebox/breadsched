			<h4>Welcome to BreadSched, a website to help you time your bread just
				right!</h4>

				time, every time. Baking bread isn't easy and getting

				challenge.</p>

				follow baking schedule for your bread.</strong> Just
				input some estimated times into BreadSched, click
				calculate, and out comes a freshly baked schedule,
				viewable on a screen or printed. Good for experienced
				and new bakers alike!</p>

			<p>BreadSched will work for any bread, all
			you need is a basic idea of how long each of your steps
			will take. It's especially good for timing sourdough or
				other complex doughs.</p>
